This script extracts personal information from Telegram, including your name, chat ID, and other details. It also uses a library to send you the date and time of the info request. It is easy to use and doesn't require any technical knowledge. You can use this information for various purposes, like generating reports or analyzing usage patterns. Whether you're a frequent Telegram user or just want to understand your account better, this script is a helpful resource.


## Getting Started

To run the code, you will need to install the following libraries:<br />
    1- python-telegram-bot: This library provides a Python interface for the Telegram Bot API.<br />
    2- pytz: This library provides time zone data for Python.<br />

```
pip install python-telegram-bot pytz
```

This will install the required libraries.<br /><br />

You will also need to replace "YOUR_TOKEN" with your actual Telegram bot token in the code. You can obtain a bot token by talking to the @BotFather bot on Telegram and following the instructions here : https://t.me/botfather . <br /><br />


Once you have installed the libraries and obtained a bot token, you can run the code using Python. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the code is saved, and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```
